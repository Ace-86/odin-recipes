    <h1>Ribs Recipe</h1>
    <p> <img src="../images/ribs.jpeg"> </p>
    <h2> Summary</h2>
    <p>These are the best ribs! Baking low and slow is our secret to fall off the bone oven-baked ribs. Some people think that ribs should be left to the “pit masters” — it’s just not true. Baking ribs in the oven is seriously easy. All you need is time — 95% of the recipe time is sitting back and relaxing while the ribs bake.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chili powder</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>2 racks baby back ribs</li>
        <li>1 cup low-sodium chicken broth</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar</li>  
        <li>1 cup barbecue sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove the membrane (remember, this ensures fall off the bone ribs).</li>
        <li>Generously season both sides with salt and pepper. This is also a great opportunity for adding more flavor with your favorite spice rub.</li>
        <li>Cover the ribs with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Bake the ribs at a low temperature (275°F) for 2 ½ to 4 hours or until they are tender.</li>
        <li>Slather the baked ribs with barbecue sauce, and then broil (or grill) the ribs for a few minutes until the sauce is caramelized.</li>
    </ol>
